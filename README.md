# week-3-game

I created a Guess What letter Im thinking of game.

I used Javascript salong with Bootstrap to code this game.

This game will:

1.)Take in a computer guess at random (console logged the variable)

2.)Take in user inputs using "onkeyup" function (console logged their input)

3.)Compare the two variables and decrease the Guesses Left if wrong, if right, it will alert "You've Won!"

4.)Once Guesses Left is at zero, it will alert "You lose! try again!" 

5.)The game will restart if lost or won, giving a new computer choice of letter at random and update the Win or Losses variable by one.
